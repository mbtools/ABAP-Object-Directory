# ABAP-Object-Directory

Quickly reference which objects exist in which release. You can use the tools to create a central object directory with details for function modules, classes, and interfaces.

- Object directory (`TADIR`)
- Function modules (`TFDIR`)
- Function module parameters (`FUPAREF`)
- Class/Interface components (`SEOCOMPODF`)
- Class/Interface component parameters (`SEOSUBCODF`)

## Prequisite

You have access to a system of each release you are interested in (at least once).

## Download

Download the lists from existing systems, for example 702, 750, and 754.

## Upload

Consolidate the lists from various systems/releases into one system. 

## Analysis

Use SE16 to browse, search, and compare the lists. 

Here's an example of 702 data that was uploaded to a 754 system.
